Scala OOP
Project where we display all 4 principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Scala (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation)

It's a simple data entry program where you tell the program the name of your team and then feed it with information from the games, the current version only allows score information but anyone can easily expand it.

Hope you find it helpful!
