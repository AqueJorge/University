### Historical Context
Digital economy refers to a type of economy where computing technologies are fully immersed in the process, where economic activities are based on these sorts of digital technologies. This can be, according to American statistician Thomas L. Mesenbourg, in any one of three different capacities:
-	E-business infrastructure: where activities are digitalized by hardware, telecoms, networks, everything tangible that makes digital technologies what it is.
-	E-business: this is how business is conducted; therefore, we can think of this as simply as registering online to a subscription letter or log in to your favorite website. Small acts of information sharing that don’t ask for anything in return.
-	E-commerce: last but not least, what we all think when the concept digital economy arises, the process of making online transactions. We’re down to the most basic type of trading, reflected on your usual Amazon, Mercado Libre, Facebook Market, etc. type of deal.

The term Digital Economy comes from Japan’s 1990 recession, but it was popularized in Don Tapscott’s book: “The Digital Economy: Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence” first published in 1995. It’s also been called the Internet Economy, the New Economy, the Web Economy, amongst others. This economy has been the evolution and result of connections among people, businesses, devices, processes, overall, everything connected through the internet, in fact, when Dan Tapscott’s book came out, people started highlighting the advantages of shifting to digital actions, based on the fact that the would be instant, global and even physically less demanding than the average day-to-day transaction. More recently, this economy has been described as the branch of economic studying “zero marginal cost intangible goods over the internet. More recently, it’s seen as a menace to “traditional” economy, given the fact that it’s changing the notions about how businesses are structured, how consumers obtain services, goods or information, and it’s also challenging states as to how they can deal and adapt to new regulatory challenges.

### Information Technology in Economic Rises
It is widely accepted that the growth of the digital economy has widespread impact on the whole economy. Eg. Telestra, a leading Australian telecoms provider, predicted competition would become more global and more intense because of the digital economy.
According to the OECD, the Digital Economy can be defined in three different approaches:
-	Bottom-up approach: characterizing industries’ and firms ‘output or production processes to decide whether they should be included in the Digital Economy
-	Top-down or trend-based approach: first identifying the key trends driving the digital transformation and then analyzing the extent to which these are reflected in the real economy 
-	Flexible or tiered approach: breaking the Digital Economy into core and non-core components, and thereby finding a compromise between adaptability and the need to arrive at some common ground on the meaning of the term

Using data which included information from 39 countries from all around the world and their development from 1980 to 1995, Pohjola concluded that “investment in information technology, has a strong influence on economic growth in developed (OECD) countries. Its impact is almost as large as that of the rest of the capital stock” [1]. Then, on a different study which included a sample of 149 countries over the period 1980-2015, Majeed and Ayub concluded that “the results show that all indicators of ICT accelerate both global and regional economic growth. However, some indicators such as online service, telecommunication infrastructure and e-government are comparatively more conducive in enhancing economic growth” [2], where the acronym ICT means Information and Communication Technology. 

This all became really apparent after the recent life change caused by COVID-19. Where communication infrastructures proved to be the main channel in which to keep the economy going, interacting, collaborating, and exchanging information. All in all, this pandemic sped up the conversion process and forced businesses to adapt into the “new” economy business model. Many experts acknowledge the difficulty of precisely evaluating a digital economy characterized by rapidly changing products and services. By 2019, researchers estimated that “the digital economy is worth $11.5 trillion globally, equivalent to 15.5 percent of global GDP and has grown two and a half times faster than global GDP over the past 15 years.” [3]
