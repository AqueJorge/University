## Introduction to Huffman Compression
In 1951, David Huffman and his classmates in the subject “Information Theory” were allowed to choose between taking a final exam or presenting a paper. Professor Robert. M. Fano assigned the working conditions under the premise of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to demonstrate which code was more efficient, gave up and began studying for the final exam. While in this process the idea of using ordered frequency binary trees came to his mind and he quickly proved that this was the most efficient method.

With this study, Huffman surpassed his professor, who had worked with the inventor of information theory Claude Shannon in order to develop a similar code. Huffman fixed most of the bugs in the Shannon-Fano encoding algorithm. The solution was based on the process of building the tree from bottom to top instead of the other way around.

In computer science and information theory, Huffman encoding is an algorithm used for data compression. The term refers to the use of a variable length code table to encode a certain symbol (such as a character in a file), where the table has been filled in a specific way based on the estimated probability of occurrence of each possible value of said symbol. It was developed by David A. Huffman while a PhD student at MIT, and published in "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".

Huffman encoding uses a specific method to choose the representation of each symbol, which gives rise to a prefix code (that is, the bit string representing a particular symbol is never a prefix to the bit string of a different symbol) representing the most common characters using the shortest bit strings, and vice versa. Huffman was able to design the most efficient compression method of this type: no alternative representation of a set of input symbols produces a smaller mean output when the symbol frequencies match those used to create the code. Later a method was found to do this in linear time if the probabilities of the input symbols (also known as "weights") are ordered.

Compression and Data Science deal with exactly the same problem: understanding the data. The better you can understand the data the better the model you can make from it and then with careful encoding you can have a minimum description length for the data. So not only data science can be used for data compression, data science IS data compression and data compression IS data science.

If we think about generative models, the models that create data similar to what we have then we can argue that the best generative model is also the best compression model because you need to understand data to generate, mimic data accurately and if you can understand data then you can compress it.

## Methodology
The technique used is Huffman's own algorithm. It consists of creating a binary tree in which the leaf nodes are labeled with the characters, along with their frequencies, and each pair of nodes that add less frequency are joined consecutively, creating a new intermediate node labeled with said sum. This action is carried out until there are no leaf nodes left to join any superior node, and the binary tree has been formed.

Subsequently, the edges that join each of the nodes are labeled with zeros and ones (right and left son, respectively, for example). The resulting code for each character is the reading, following the branch, from the root to each character (or vice versa) of each of the edge labels.
Building the tree:
1. Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap of all leaf nodes (Min Heap is used as a priority queue. The value of frequency field is used to compare two nodes in min heap. Initially, the least frequent character is at root)
2. Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap.
3. Create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the heap contains only one node. The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.

## Results
The code works as intended and we tried with 3 different files, all of them containing Genesis 1 from the Bible. The difference is that one file is in English, one in Spanish and the last one in Greek. This allows us to see the difference in input and output files (original and compressed). As we could observe the highest initial frecuencies were:
- English: e, t, a and d
- Spanish: a, e, s and l
- Greek: τ, α, ν and ε

We can notice the difference in languages almost immediately. Spanish and English differ in letters, but the Greek one is different from a symbolic point of view.
Another important feature to notice is the difference in the amount of characters used. As we could observe, the character count gave us:
- English: 44 characters
- Spanish: 48 characters
- Greek: 70 characters

This also already sets a different path from the Greek coding in relation to the others.
After creating our Huffman Tree, we have the "path" or binary encoding for each letter in each language. We can see that using our code, the largest character count in binary is:
- English: 12
- Spanish: 12
- Greek: 12

Which means the Greek tree is distributed well if the maximum length of 70 characters can have the same one as one of 44 characters (the English one). However if we take a look at the symbols they differ quite a bit when following the distribution of all 3 languages. 

The Huffman magic comes in play when we watch the difference in size when comparing the compressed binaries to the original ones.
- English: from  3.97 KB to 2.123 KB
- Spanish: from 3.76 KB to 2.026 KB
- Greek: from  8.08 KB to 2.463 KB

We could already see it coming from the maximum character length and although every file reduced in size, the Greek file is the most noticeable.

## Conclusions
Data compression and data science are related as it helps to better store and possibly explote the data, which increases the efficiency of the program and helps the process of data analysis. This is in the general sense that we should strive to reduce the space occupied by files to make it easier to manage and at the same time, reducing storage costs.

We, as a team, consider that through the Huffman Coding processing of a large well-known manuscript (such as the Bible) in several languages, we can create a "generic" dictionary or encryption key to compress files of those languages and just store them with the original character length and the compressed file, so the key can work correctly (we already managed to do it with Genesis 1!). This could help in diminishing the space needed in databases to browse through manuscripts, ans also a more ordered way to distinguish each file while having them grouped by language.

Through our research we noticed that we could also implement more algorithms to filter the texts and classify the texts by language and then use the already stored dictionary (which was generated by the Huffman tree) and in doing so, automating the process, of say, scripting texts.

We also consider that using the Huffman "algorithm" probably isn't the best way to go about compressing anything, since there are more complicated algorithms out there. However, we also found it interesting, because while talking about characters, we were able to learn about the importance and difference in letter frequencies amongst languages. Which could also be consider as the basis of cryptography.
